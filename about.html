    <h2>About DebAIt</h2>
    <p>
        DebAIt is an academic project that uses AI to simulate debate partners for students.
        Instead of only reading arguments in a textbook, learners can ask questions, get a
        clear response, and then practice agreeing, disagreeing, or refining the position.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main goal is not to “win” debates, but to help users:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Practice building logical, well-structured arguments</li>
        <li>See multiple perspectives on complex issues</li>
        <li>Reflect on their own reasoning and potential biases</li>
        <li>Prepare for essays, presentations, or class discussions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How DebAIt Works</h2>
    <p>
        DebAIt is split into a simple front end and an AI-powered back end:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Front end:</strong> HTML and CSS pages for Home, Start Debate, Explore, and About.</li>
        <li><strong>Debate flow:</strong> The user enters a question or topic, and the system generates an AI stance.</li>
        <li><strong>Student role:</strong> Students read the AI’s argument, then write their own response or rebuttal.</li>
        <li><strong>Explore page:</strong> Provides sample topics that can be used in class or for practice.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

    <h2>Ethics & Limitations</h2>
    <p>
        Because DebAIt uses AI-generated responses, it is important to remember that:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>AI might oversimplify or miss important context in complex topics.</li>
        <li>Responses should be treated as starting points, not final answers.</li>
        <li>Students are encouraged to fact-check claims and bring in real sources.</li>
        <li>Debates involving sensitive topics should be handled respectfully and thoughtfully.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small-text">
        DebAIt is meant as a learning tool to support critical thinking, not to replace research,
        teachers, or expert feedback.
